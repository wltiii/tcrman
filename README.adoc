== Purpose
To provide a quick way to change or apply appropriate *tcr* - 
_(test && commit) || revert_ - variants to projects.


== Motivation
Using tcr can be likened to doing *TDD* on steriods. Inspired 
by projects like _SDKMAN_, the blog post _TCR Variants (test && commit || revert)_ and 
the fact that many developers work as consultants or on diverse projects with
different toolchains, a simple tool for installing and switching variants seemed necessary.

It is hoped that this tool will:
. increase adoption of tcr (and have more code driven by tests).
. be flexible to meet needs of diverse development environments
. expand upon variations 
. share knowledge within the community.

== Getting Started
=== Linux Installation
==== Initial Setup
. Install inotify-tools, if not already installed. 
+
`sudo apt install inotify-tools`
. Clone this project
. Create TCRMAN_HOME environment variable
. Make tcrman script executable:
+
`chmod u+x $TCRMAN_HOME/tcrman`
. Add $TCRMAN_HOME to your path
==== Project Setup
. From your project root, run:
+
`tcrman`
+
This will install the tcr into your project, which will use:
. build automation: *gradle*
. test using: *gradle*
. version control: *git*
. tcr variant: *otcr* - the relaxed variant.

=== Configuring tcrman
You can configure tcrman to use a different build tool, version 
control system or tcr variant. For example, run command:

`tcrman -b gradle -t gradle -v git -x rtcr`

This configures tcr to use gradle as a build tool, gradle for testing, git for version
control and the wtcr variant for tcr. You can configure any or all
as desired. 

Note that when configuring tcr to one of the continuous variants, it will
run the previously defined variant continuously. Continuous variants
are the variants prefixed with _w_. For example:

`tcrman -x wrtcr`

This will run the rtcr variant continuously.

To see how tcrman is currently configured and available 
options, run:
`tcrman -s`

=== The (test && commit) || revert Variants
Note that these can all be customized. See below.

The default non-continuous variants are:

=== Running (test && commit) || revert
The tcr variants are of two types: non-continuous and continuous. Running
a non-continuous variant is as simple as running `tcr` from your project root.

A continuous variant is only slightly more complicated. Open a second shell
and run `tcr` from there. That way you can observe what it is doing as you
work.

=== Customizing
There is a large variety of environments and an even larger variety of tools to
support those environments. A core tenant of this project is that it must be
easily extensible. While the initial releases have been developed to meet the
developers immediate concerns, it is hoped that as others adopt usage of 
*_tcrman_* and begin create customizations, they will share back said customizations
with the community. The patterns used thus far could change to make it more
flexible, but developers who do create their own customizations would do well
to understand and use the patterns used as best they can.
