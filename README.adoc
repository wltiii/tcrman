== Purpose
To provide a quick way to change or apply appropriate *tcr* - 
_(test && commit) || revert_ - variants to projects.


== Motivation
Using tcr can be likened to doing *TDD* on steriods. Inspired 
by the blog post _TCR Variants (test && commit || revert)_ (see
References below) and the fact that I am a consultant, I wanted a
simple tool for installing and switching variants as needed.

It is hoped that this tool will:
. increase adoption of tcr (and have more code driven by tests).
. be flexible to meet needs of diverse development environments
. expand upon variations 
. share knowledge within the community.

== Getting Started
=== Linux Installation
==== Initial Setup
. Install inotify-tools, if not already installed. 
+
`sudo apt install inotify-tools`
. Clone this project
. Create TCRMAN_HOME environment variable
. Make tcrman script executable:
+
`chmod u+x {tcrman-home}/tcrman`
. Add {tcrman-home} to your path
==== Project Setup
. From your project root, run:
+
`tcrman -i`
+
This will install the default tcr into your project, which will use:
. build automation: *gradle*
. test using: *gradle*
. version control: *git*
. tcr variant: *rtcr* - the relaxed variant.

=== Mac Installation
_not yet implemented_

=== Windows Installation
_not yet implemented_

=== Configuring tcrman
You can configure tcrman to use a different build tool, version 
control system or tcr variant. For example, run command:

`tcrman -b gradle -t gradle -v git -x rtcr`

This configures tcr to use gradle as a build tool, git for version
control and the wtcr variant for tcr. You can configure any or all
as desired. 

Note that when configuring tcr to one of the continuous variants, it will
run the previously defined variant continuously. If you to run a different
variant coninuously, you have two options. The first is to specify the
target tcr variant, then specify the continuous variant. Alternatively,
you can specify the continuous variant and the target in one command. For
example:
`tcrman --wtcr-rtcr`

This will run the rtcr variant continuously using the wtcr variant.

To see how tcr is currently configured, run:
`tcrman --show`

To see a list of available build tools, run:
`tcrman --build`

To see a list of available version control tools, run:
`tcrman --vcs`

To see a list of tcr variants, run:
`tcrman --tcr`

=== The (test && commit) || revert Variants
Note that these can all be customized. See below.

The default non-continuous variants are:
|===
| Variant | Description
| btcr    | build && test && (commit || revert source and test code) 
| ctcr    | -- not yet implemented -- 
| gtcr    | -- not yet implemented -- gentle tcr stashes changes so they can be recovered 
| otcr    | the original tcr. test && (commit || revert source and test code) 
| *?tcr*    | the original tcr. test && (commit || revert source only) 
| rtcr    | relaxed tcr. build && test && (commit || revert source only) 
|===

The default continuous variants are:
|===
| Variant | Description
| wbtcr    | continuously runs the btcr variant
| wctcr    | -- not yet implemented -- 
| wgtcr    | -- not yet implemented -- gentle tcr stashes changes so they can be recovered 
| wotcr    | continuously runs the otcr variant
| *w?tcr*    | continuously runs the *w?tcr* variant 
| wrtcr    | continuously runs the rtcr variant 
|===

=== Running tcrman
As alluded to above, there are several options 

=== Running (test && commit) || revert
The tcr variants are of two types: non-continuous and continuous. Running
a non-continuous variant is as simple as running `tcr` from your project root.

A continuous variant is only slightly more complicated. Open a second shell
and run `tcr` from there. That way you can observe what it is doing as you
work.

=== Customizing
There is a large variety of environments and an even larger variety of tools to
support those environments. A core tenant of this project is that it must be
easily extensible. While the initial releases have been developed to meet the
developers immediate concerns, it is hoped that as others adopt usage of 
`tcrman` and begin create customizations, they will share back said customizations
with the community. The patterns used thus far could change to make it more
flexible, but developers who do create their own customizations would do well
to understand and the patterns used as best they can.
